        <question>Selecting a RACE COURSE for today</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>The Sailing Committee has recommended courses for each of the cardinal wind directions. The
                courses also include options for light winds and low tide conditions. Each course is shown as it
                should be displayed on the course board and includes tips on how to position the inflatable buoys.
            </p>

            <p>The courses can be viewed by selecting the <b>CourseFinder</b> option on the Status Page</p>

        <question>Quick Overview on running a club PURSUIT RACE</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
        <p>Currently we have two \'club pursuit\' days - the Patrick Kelley Pursuit and the RNLI Pursuit.  The pursuit races are not sailed by the multihulls,
        so separate trophy races are run for them at the same time.  These notes provide a guide on how to run the pursuit race and multihull race at the same time using racemanager</p>
        <p><b>Step 1</b> - Set a course for the two fleets.  In general you want to sail the multihulls \'outside\' the pursuit course as far as possible.  Its also a good idea to have long laps -
        the fewer laps there are to record the easier it is for the racebox crew.  Use a special start for the start line.  This will keep the boats starting separated from the
        multihulls lapping round buoy 29.  Brief the safety boat teams on the course (a hand- drawn map can be useful) and give them the waterproof notebooks they will use to record finishers.
         Agree who is going to be the primary finish boat (finishing the leading boats) and who will be the secondary finisher - finishing the back half of the fleet.  Check that they
         have blue flags to indicate that they are the finishing boats</p>
        <p><b>Step 2</b> - Check that the start numbers in the white box are in the right sequence to show \'00\', then \'01\', then \'02\' etc. Hang the box out of the racebox window - and tie it securely.
        Agree who is going to be responsible for changing the start number at each minute</p>
        <p><b>Step 3</b> - Set the lights box to 2 starts - multihulls will start on yellow light, the first start for the pursuit will start on the green light</p>
        <p><b>Step 4</b> - On racemanager open the pursuit race and then go to the STATUS page and find the \'get start times\' button - click this and complete the form.  Normally the ILCA6 will be the slowest boat and
        the RS800 will be the fastest boat allowed.  The race time will be 90 minutes and you will be starting at 1 minute intervals.  Print two copies of the start times and post them near the course board.
        Go back to the racemanager \'programme\' page</p>
        <p><b>Step 5</b> - Hold a competitor briefing - there are lots of differences from normal race days.</p>
        <p><b>Step 6</b> - Open the multihull race in racemanager, set the no. of laps and then go to the START page.  Start the race sequence in the normal way
        pressing the lights box green button and the start timer button in racemanager (which will also load the multihull entries).
        Take a note of start time for the multihulls - i.e. start of sequence time +6 mins. Then go back to the racemanager \'programme\' page </p>
        <p><b>Step 7</b> - Open the pursuit race in racemanager - go to the START page and click the start timer button <b>on the 3 minute gun</b> for the Multihulls.
        Take a note of the time of the first pursuit start (i.e. +3  minutes from now and also the time of the end of the race i.e. +93 minutes from now).</p>
        <p><b>Step 8</b> - Go to the ENTRIES page and use the Print Entries button (pursuit laps option) to get sheets to record laps crossings.</p>
        <p><b>Step 9</b> - Check the start for the multihulls - take a note of any OCS boats (and signal them as required).</p?
        <p><b>Step 10</b> - At the start for the pursuit race - change the start number in the white box to \'01\'.  The person managing the white box
        should now focus on changing the start number <b>EVERY MINUTE</b> until all the starts are completed.  On the START page in racemanager you will get a list of which
        boats are starting at each minute.  If there are boats starting on a particular minute you should sound the horn on their start.  If any boats are OCS you should sound the horn again
        and display the orange beacon for thirty seconds.  If an OCS boat does not return you can score them as OCS directly on the start page.  Continue through all of the starts until they
        are complete.  You should be aware that the multihulls may be completing their first lap and you will need to switch races in racemanager to time them - or you can simply record their lap times
        on paper and then enter them when the pursuit starts are completed (click the boat and then edit the lap time).</p>
        <p><b>Step 11</b> - Throughout the race, monitor where the leading boats in both races are on the race course.  You should be recording lap times for the multihulls in racemanager - use shorten course
        as necessary to finish them after they have been sailing for 60 minutes.  The lap crossing for the pursuit race will be recorded on paper sheets - just a tick for a lap - no need to record times </p>
        <p><b>Step 12</b> - About 10 minutes before the finish of the pursuit ask the primary RIB to start tracking the leading boat , and the secondary RIB to be tracking the middle of the fleet.
        Give them a clear countdown to the end of the race.  In the racebox continue recording lap crossings for the pursuit boats until all boats have finished</p>
        <p><b>Step 13</b> - The RIBs should be encouraged to get the on-the-water finishing records to the racebox as quickly as possible. Use the help button on the TIMER page to view
        the topic: How to record FINISHES for a PURSUIT race.  This explains how to create the results and save them.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p> . . . and breathe - you are done for the day </p>

        <notes><![CDATA[
            <p>Note:  If a suitably configured laptop is available it can be easier to run the multihull race on the laptop and the pursuit race on the main racebox PC.  Check with
            your racemanager support folks to see if this can be arranged.</p>

        <question>Managing MULTIPLE RACES</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>Some suggestions if you are scheduled to run more than multiple races at Starcross YC.
            <p>
            <p>First of all when setting the course for the first race - consider what changes you will make to the
                course for subsequent races to keep it <u>interesting for the competitors</u>. It is relatively easy
                to adjust the amount of running / broad reaching /and close reaching by simply changing a single buoy on the course board or
                physically moving the inflatable buoys. The competitors will appreciate the change of scenery.
            </p>
            <p>Organise a briefing for competitors before the first race. Explain the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you will try to turn around the races quickly - the aim will be that the warning signal for the
                    second race will be made within 5 minutes of the last boat finishing the first race. If this is not
                    possible a postponement will be signalled - the postponement will be cancelled no less than 3
                    minutes before the warning signal for the first start.
                <br><br></li>
                <li>you will likely change the course between races - remind them to watch for Flag C and a sound signal<br><br></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>FIRST RACE</b> - run this as usual - selecting the relevant race on the raceManager racebox PROGRAMME page. Do not let
                this race overrun - be ready to shorten course for all boats to be finished with elapsed times of 45-55 minutes. While the final few boats are finishing -
                ask the safety boats to adjust the course for the second race.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once all the boats have finished, <b>SAVE</b> the results (on the results page) even if there are still some
                issues to resolve. Take note of any outstanding issues - but leave fixing them until all the races are complete. Do NOT close the race
                at this stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>SECOND RACE</b> - go back to the PROGRAMME page (click the green text on the left hand side of the top
                 navigation bar) and select the second race and run it as normal. To restart the lights
                box turn the power off for 30 seconds and then power on. You can now start the race as usual. Once all
                the boats have finished this race, SAVE the results but do NOT close the race
            </p>
            <p>Now return to the racebox PROGRAMME page and select the first race again. Resolve any outstanding
                issues with the results for this race and SAVE your changes and print the race results. You can now CLOSE this race. Repeat
                the same process for the second race.
            </p>
        ]]></answer>
        <notes><![CDATA[
            <p>Note: leaving outstanding results issues until all races have been completed takes the pressure off the OOD
                team trying to sort out the result for Race 1 while starting the next race. Saving the interim results
                immediately after each race has the effect of creating a safety backup of the data. It is a good idea to select
                "no upload to the website" when saving the draft results.

        <question>What is the STATUS PAGE for?</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>This page gives you information on the race you are running - specifically the race format (start
                sequence, signals etc.). It allows you to change some programme details (e.g. name of race officer)
            </p>
            <p>It also allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set the number of laps for each fleet</li>
                <li>Send an email to the team responsible for managing your raceManager system</li>
                <li>Mark the race as ABANDONED or CANCELLED</li>
                <li>CLOSE the race when you have finished or otherwise scored all competitors</li>
                <li>RESET the entire race if you want to start again</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will normally use this page at the beginning of your race officer duty to check the race format and
                set laps - and at the end of the race to indicate if it was abandoned / cancelled or to close a
                successfully completed race. You might also wish to send a message to the raceManager team to explain
                any problems you had with the software or issues with the results.</p>
            ]]></answer>
        <notes>
            <p>Use the RESET option with care - <b>you will lose any lap timings you have recorded</b>.

        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>Resetting a race should be an absolute last resort</p>
            <p>If you really want to start the entire race again in raceManager there is a reset option on the STATUS
                page. Click the RESET button and then enter the confirmation word and click the submit button to activate the reset
            </p>
            <p>You will lose all the entries and laptimes that you have entered. However if you are using the SAILOR
                application for collecting entries these will still be available for you to reenter in the normal
                way.

                <b>DO NOT USE THIS APPROACH if you have already started a fleet</b>

            <p>You can abandon a race at any time from the STATUS page - just click the ABANDON button. You can also change
                your mind and unabandon the race as long as you continued to record lap times

            <b>IMPORTANT ... at Starcross YC our Sailing Instructions allow us to CURTAIL a club race rather than
                abandon it.
            </b>
        </h4>
        <p>You SHOULD use this approach if all the boats still racing in a fleet have <u>finished at least one lap</u> as
            this allows us to get results from a race that would otherwise be lost. It is most often used
            if the wind dies to nothing towards the end of a race. To CURTAIL a race go to the results page and
            use the <b>Change Finish Lap</b> option to set a new finish lap - this will have the following effect:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>average lap racing</b>: set the finish lap to the last one that the <u>leading boat</u> in each fleet
                completed, and then give aggregate times to all the other boats based on the number of laps they completed.
            </li>
            <li><b>handicap/class racing</b>: set the finish lap for each fleet to be the <u>highest lap number that all
            boats still racing in the fleet have completed</u>. The results will then be calculated based on the lap times for that lap.
            So if all boats have finished 2 laps and some boats have finished 3 - set the finish lap to 2.</li>
        </ul>
        ]]></answer>
        <notes><![CDATA[
        <p>Note: This function can also be useful if you have forgotten to shorten the race in raceManager, but have
            signalled a finish to all boats. Once you have finished all boats in this way - go to the RESULTS page and
             set the finish lap to the shortened number of laps.  </p>

            </p>
            <p>Alternatively you can use the ENTER BOATS button to search the database for boats to enter. You can
                search for the sail number, class name, or helms surname. The system will find all matches in the
                database and then you can select the boats to enter.
            </p>
            <p>The entries will be shown for each fleet as a separate tab - click the tab to see a fleet entries. You
                can edit an entry - changing the crew, sail number, or handicap for this race only. You can also mark a
                competitor for doing a club duty - they will be allocated points for the race according to the way your
                raceManager system is configured.
            </p>
            <p>If you have new boats (i.e not in the database), or a new class of boat you should use the REGISTER NEW
                CLASS and/or REGISTER NEW BOAT buttons to add the details to the database. Once in the database you can
                enter them in the normal way.
            </p>
            <p>Finally you can use the PRINT ENTRIES button to get a list of entries in a variety of formats.</p>

        <question>I cannot find the boat I want to enter</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>This generally only occurs if your club does not use the raceManager SAILOR application to allow the
                competitor to create their own entry or if you have a new competitor that is unfamiliar with the SAILOR application.
            </p>

            <p>The Enter Boat button on the ENTRIES page allows you to search using sail number, class name, or helm
                surname. If you cannot find the boat you are looking for it is probably because it is not in the
                raceManager database. In this case you will need to add the new boat using the Register New Boat button
                - just fill in the form.
            </p>
            <p>Important - after registering the new boat you will still need to use the Enter Boat button to enter it in the normal
                way.
            </p>
        ]]></answer>
        <notes><![CDATA[
            <p>In very rare cases you may have a new boat which belongs to a class that is not recognised by raceManager.
                In this case use the Register Class button first to create the new class. Then use the Register New Boat
                button to create the new boat in the new class, and finally use the Enter Boat button to enter it into
                the race.

        <question>What is the START PAGE for?</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>This page is used to start the race timer and manage the start sequence.</p>
            <p>Use the START TIMER button to start the raceManager clock at the same time as you make the first WARNING
                signal (e.g. 6 minute gun) for the first fleet in the start sequence. This will start the master
                countdown clock - and the individual fleet start countdowns. Once the countdowns to each start is
                complete the clocks will show the elapsed time for each fleet.
            </p>
            <p>If you want to stop the clock and reset the start sequence (e.g if you decide to change the course) -
                click the Timer button again (it will ask you to confirm the action by typing “stop”).
            </p>
            <p>30 seconds before each fleet starts the “Start Infringements” and “General Recall” buttons will be
                enabled. Use the START INFRINGEMENTS button to record start line infringements such as OCS, DNS, DNC
                etc.. If you decide to have a general recall use the GENERAL RECALL button to enter the wall clock time
                for the actual start time of the fleet in question</p>
        ]]></answer>
        <notes><![CDATA[
            <p>Note:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you forget to start the Timer when you begin the flags/lights start sequence - use the “Forgot to
                    start the timer” button below the timer start button. This will allow you to enter the wall clock
                    time that you actually began the start sequence.
                </li>
                <li>The timer displays for each fleet will flash 30 seconds before each start to alert you to an
                    upcoming start .

        <question>I forgot to start the RACE TIMER</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>This is a relatively common mistake.</p>
            <p>use the "Forgot to Start Timer" button on the TIMER page. This will allow you to enter the clock time
                (hh:mm:ss) for the time you should have started the timer - i.e. the time you made the first signal in
                the start sequence.
            </p>
        ]]></answer>
        <notes><![CDATA[
            <p>Obviously you should try to input an accurate time for the first signal - but it does not need to be
                accurate to within a few seconds - small errors are unlikely to have a significant impact on the results.

        <question>How do I handle a GENERAL RECALL?</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>If you signal a general recall for a fleet - that fleet must restart AFTER the remaining fleets have
                started. Once the other fleets have started use the following procedure to start the recalled fleet:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>restart the lights system (power off / power on) - set the number of starts to 1 (or however many fleets you have recalled)</li>
                <li>IMPORTANT - do NOT stop/restart the raceManager timer
                <li>start the recalled start sequence on the light box - press the green button (take a note of the wall clock time of the setting the start sequence</li>
                <li>if you want to use the black flag - hoist it at the 3 minute sound signal</li>
                <li>on the START page in raceManager click the General Recall option for the fleet(s) in question - enter the clocktime (hh:mm:ss) of the start gun for the recalled fleet
                (i.e. the time you previously noted + 6 minutes)</li>
                <li>. . . continue to run the race as normal</li>

        <question>What is the TIMER PAGE for?</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>This is the page where you record lap times for each boat - and you will spend most of the race on this
                page.
            </p>
            <p>The default display uses the Tabbed fleet organisation - click the relevant tab to view a fleet. To time
                a lap - just click the watch next to the relevant boat and the lap time will appear. Colour shading is
                used to indicate which boats are no longer racing, or on their last lap, or finished.
            </p>
            <p>You can also do the following for each boat:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delete (UNDO) the last lap time recorded</li>
                <li>Set a scoring code (e.g. DNF, NSC etc.)</li>
                <li>Edit and/or delete recorded lap times</li>
                <li>Add the boat to a ‘bunch’ list to help manage a group of boats crossing the club line in a bunch</li>
                <li>Finish the boat at a lap other than the finish lap - average lap racing only.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To shorten the course for one fleet - click the orange button above the list of boats - the race will then
                finish on the next lap. Alternatively you can click the SHORTEN ALL FLEETS button on the right of the
                page. This will shorten all fleets at their next lap.
            </p>
            <p>If you have many fleets and many competitors you may benefit from using one of the alternative TIMER
                views - click the CHANGE VIEW option on the black menu bar - top right. This will then give you the option of
                condensed views which will allow you to see all boats racing without having to scroll or change tabs.
                The three condensed views are organised by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Sail Number</b>
                    - best option for lots of boats (50+)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Class</b>
                    - best option if you have relatively few classes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fleet</b>
                    - best option if fleets tend not to be well separated on the race course
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most of the functions of the tabbed display are available. Time laps by clicking the relevant boat button
                - or use the gear wheel menu to get the other functions. You can switch between the different views at
                any time. If you have relatively few classes the class view is probably the best option.</p>

        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>The most common OOD mistake when using raceManager is to signal a shortened course with the beacon lights and hoot when the leading boat
            crosses the finish line . . . BUT HAVE FORGOTTEN to reduce the no. of laps in raceManager.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2em"><b>Do Not Panic . . .</b></p><br>
            <p>Click the button labelled <b>Change Shorten Lap</b> on the right hand side of the screen</p>
            <p>Now change the lap for each fleet you want to shorten and submit the form.  The system will then finish the boats that you have already finished in the shortened race,
            and will correctly finish the boats that still have to complete the race as they cross the line.

        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>On the TIMER page - using the TABBED view find the boat which needs the lap time correction.
                Click the edit icon (pencil) and the lap times recorded for that boat will be shown. Edit the incorrect
                lap times by entering the correct elapsed time in hh:mm:ss format.
            </p>
            <p>When you have completed the corrections - click the <b>Update Lap Times</b> button to apply them.</p>
            <p>If you want to add a missed lap - just click the boat record to get a new lap - then use the edit button
                again to make the relevant corrections to each lap.</p>
            <p>Similarly if you want to remove a lap time - just click the Delete Lap option.

        <notes><![CDATA[
            <p>If the error you want to correct is a finishing time - the edit function on the
                RESULTS page provides a more comprehensive mechanism to correct this time and make other changes (e.g. no. of laps, apply
                penalty points, change PY number, add crew name etc.)

        <question>How to record FINISHES for a PURSUIT race</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
        <p>Before you start recording finishes in the pursuit race, you should have the paper record of the no. of laps completed by each boat,
        and the finish lists generated on the RIBs.  You should also check that the finish lists are legible and understandable - if not ask the
        person who did the recording to interpret them for you.</p>

        <p>Then do the following: </p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Step 1</b> - Arrange the results books in order from the first finish (leaders) to last finish (back markers) - be careful it is surprisingly easy to make a mistake if you have more than two finishes</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b> - Starting with the last finish list (back markers) <u>click the flag icon </u> next to the first boat recorded on this list - then on the right hand side of the screen add the
        number of the finish line (e.g. 2 if it was the second finish line), the number of laps completed and the position of the boat on that finish line (i.e. 1st).  Click UPDATE to set the finish.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b> - Now select the next boat on finish line 2  - the system will display the boat in the right hand panel and will update the finish position to the next
        in sequence. Click UPDATE to set the finish</li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b> - Once you have completed the finish list - process the next one (e.g. finish line 1) in the same way - remembering their position should be relative to that line
         not to the overall race.  You may find that a boat you have previously recorded as finishing is also recorded as finishing on the current line you are processing.
         In this situation - you should ignore the boat on the finish line you are currently processing and move to the next one. </li>
         <li><b>Step 5</b> - When you have completed recording the finishes on all lines - check if any boats have not been scored.  These boats will usually be DNF, RTD, NSC -
         set the relevant scoring code using the black gearwheel icon.</li>
         <li><b>Step 6</b> - Look for any boats that have not been finished or given a scoring code. Usually this is because they did not finish and were not spotted coming ashore early,
          or were missed by the finishing boats (often boats between the two finish lines).  If you are unable to work out where they finished from the evidence you have the ask the crew where they finished
          </li>
         <li><b>Step 7</b> - On the TIMER page set the display mode to \'finish line\'.  Now do a boat by boat check of the position on the screen and the position in the finish line books.</li>
         <li><b>Step 8</b> - Go to the RESULTS page and use \'Save Results\' to archive and publish the results.</li>
         </ul>

        <question>What is the RESULTS PAGE for?</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>This page allows you to check the race results and correct any mistakes, before publishing them . Once
                published you can print the race results (and updated series results where relevant). The results will
                also be made available on the club website.
            </p>
            <p>The results for each fleet are accessed in the normal way using the relevant tab at the top of the page.
                The tabs include an indication of whether the results are complete or have problems that need resolving
                (normally one or more boats who haven’t been finished or given a scoring code such as DNF). When you
                click a fleet tab the system, when relevant, will present a list of possible problems with the results.
            </p>
            <p>You can correct the results - setting scoring codes and using the edit option to update details about the
                competitor and their finishing time and no. of laps completed.
            </p>
            <p>The results page also gives you an option to change the lap used to finish each fleet - this can be
                    useful if you signalled a shortened course and finished the boats, but forgot to record that
                    shortened course in raceManager. Further details on how to use this function are provided in the separate help topic “I forgot
                    to shorten the course” on the Timer page.

            <p>Once you are happy the results are complete and correct - use the SAVE RESULTS button to produce the results
                files that you can print and will be automatically posted to the club website. As part of this process
                you will need to add information on the wind conditions during the race and select some options for the

        <question>What if you are unable to resolve problems with the RESULTS?</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>Do NOT Panic!</p>

            <p> If raceManager is indicating there are errors and you cannot resolve them - do the following:
            <ul>
            <li>use the <b>SAVE Results</b> option on the RESULTS page.  This has the effect of taking a safe copy of the results
            so that they cannot be lost. (<i>It is a good idea to select the "do not publish to website" option</i>)<br><br></li>
            <li>find one of the raceManager administrators and explain the problem to them<br></li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <question>How do I use the BUNCH function ?</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            <p>The recommended approach for using raceManager to record lap and finish times is to use the BUNCH
                function on the timer page - ESPECIALLY if the race has more than 20 boats.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>With this approach - one person spots approaching boats when they are about 200m from the line - calling the class and sailnumber out.
                The other person - running raceManager - clicks the blue button (with a pin icon) for each boat spotted and
                they will then appear in a list on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can now use this bunch list to easily and quickly record them as they cross the line
                - avoiding the panic of finding them in the few seconds as they cross the line.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The bunch list has up/down arrows so that you can adjust the likely order that the boats will cross
                the line to make it even easier.  You can also remove boats from the bunch list using the red delete icon.</p>
