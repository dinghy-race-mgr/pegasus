<p>This page will allow user to send email duty reminders to all selected events - 
it will use the html mailto: option as described here https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/mailto-links/ or
the sendmail code used for clubmanager.

Possible better to produce something that deals with a single event and then this could be the basis of a future automated reminder system.
