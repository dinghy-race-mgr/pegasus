Current issues:
 - fixed start time ignores tides (would be nice to include HW must be within N hours of fixed time)
 - not scheduling dinghy cruises - could use a recurrence model (e.g 1st and 3rd Saturday each month - and then look to use 2nd and 4th if already booked)
 - not allowing trophy and series race on same day (is this a good thing)
 - needs to be tested with a typical inland club events
 - should check that the race format and series are defined (option)
 - would be nice to support pairing (event X has to be scheduled on same day as event Y)
